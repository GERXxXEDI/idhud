I do it for myself, but maybe someone will find it useful too.\r\n\r\nDiscussions:\r\n* http://teamfortress.tv/thread/16751/improved-default-hud (en)\r\n* http://etf2l.org/forum/customise/topic-28385 (en)\r\n* https://pixling.ru/blog/1037.html (ru)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/lKTpY\r\n\r\n### How to turn on/off crosshairs/hitmarker\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/68363171/xhairs_205.png\r\n\r\nTo disable the hitmarker, open `scripts\\hudlayout.res`, then CTRL+F for `\"3.1\"` and change `\"visible\"` and `\"visible_minmode\"` parameter values to `\"0\"`.\r\n\r\n### How to change damage position and visibility\r\nTo enable alternative layouts, just rename `huddamageaccount_yellow.res` or `huddamageaccount_m0re.res` to `huddamageaccount.res` (placed in `resource\\ui\\` folder).\r\n\r\n### How to change scoreboard layout\r\n6v6 version is enabled by default when `cl_hud_minmode 1`. To disable, just delete `scoreboard.res` file placed in `resource\\ui\\` folder.\r\n\r\n### How to change Medic HUD layout\r\nTo enable, just rename `hudmediccharge_alt.res` to `hudmediccharge.res` (placed in `resource\\ui\\` folder) AND rename `hudanimations_tf_alt.txt` to `hudanimations_tf.txt` (placed in `scripts\\` folder). _Not recommended to use with Vaccinator._","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
